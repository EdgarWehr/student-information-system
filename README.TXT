PROJECT TITLE: Student information system

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:this system involves many different aspects of running a school or university
registration, grades, course scheduling, billing, records and so on.

VERSION or DATE: 0.1

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:Run the unit test

AUTHORS:Edgar Alberto Flores Wehr

USER INSTRUCTIONS:Abstraction lets you concentrate on the important issues about a problem,
discarding the details.

Modularization: Organize de problem on smalller parts

The student information system is primarily about students, so as your first task 
you will abstract that real-world concept into its object-oriented 
representation. A candidate class might be Student. Student objects should 
contain basic information about a student such as name, identification number, and grades. 
You will concentrate on an even smaller concern first: 
Create a unique student object that stores the name of the student.
